It was a sunny morning in Maple Hollow, but when Carrot the bunny arrived at the clearing, was wrong.

“Sadie Spot, Rosie, Spring!” Carrot called. “The slide is gone!”  

She looked around the playground, ears twitching. What should Carrot do first?

**Green**: Ask Spring if she saw anything while digging.  
**Yellow**: Check in with Sadie Spot by the sandbox.
**Red**: Look around the clearing for clues.  
**Blue**: Call everyone together and ask for help.

### Green  
Spring wagged her tail. “I didn’t see anything — but I did hear squeaky wheels rolling away really early this morning!”

### Yellow  
Sadie Spot tilted her head. “Hmm, I saw a trail of sparkly leaves headed into the trees... It looked like something big was dragged!”

### Red  
Carrot noticed a line of tiny acorn caps, all crushed in a row — like something heavy had passed through. A clue?

### Blue  
Rosie, Spring, and Sadie Spot gathered quickly. “Let’s solve this mystery together!” said Rosie, adjusting her flower crown.

Following the trail of sparkly leaves and bent grass, the friends arrived at a shady glade. A few shiny bolts and some fur tufts were scattered on the ground.  

Carrot twitched his nose. “We’re getting closer…”  

Where should they go next?

**Green**: Ask Sadie Spot to sniff out the trail.  
**Yellow**: Send Spring ahead — she’s the fastest.  
**Red**: Search the bushes together.  
**Blue**: Climb a tree for a better view.

### Green  
Sadie Spot's nose twitched. “Something big and metal went that way. Also... maple syrup?” she added, puzzled.

### Yellow  
Spring dashed ahead and barked. “There’s something shiny stuck between two trees! Come quick!”

### Red  
Behind the bushes, Rosie found a tangled vine and what looked like part of the slide’s ladder!

### Blue  
Carrot climbed up and saw faint tracks leading toward the creek. Something big had definitely passed through.

Near the creek, they found a strange sight: a squirrel’s cart loaded with shiny things — and a big red plank!  

A tiny squirrel in a helmet waved at them. “Sorry! I thought it was a ramp for my acorn stunt show!”

**Green**: Explain the slide belongs in the playground.  
**Yellow**: Offer to help the squirrel build a new ramp.  
**Red**: Gently take the slide back.  
**Blue**: Ask if the squirrel saw who helped him move it.

### Green  
“Oh!” said the squirrel. “I didn’t know! Of course you can take it back!”

### Yellow  
“You’d help?” The squirrel's eyes sparkled. “Okay! Let’s return the slide and build a better ramp together!”

### Red  
The squirrel stepped aside politely. “Sorry again. I didn’t mean to cause trouble.”

### Blue  
“A big deer helped me carry it!” said the squirrel. “But not Rosie... someone with glowing antlers…”

Back at the playground, they returned the slide — but the ladder was still missing!  

“How do we climb up now?” Carrot frowned.  

Rosie tapped her hoof thoughtfully. “Maybe someone borrowed the ladder for another project…”

**Green**: Check the art wall where Spring was painting yesterday.  
**Yellow**: Look in the garden where Rosie had been earlier.  
**Red**: Ask the forest owl — he sees everything.  
**Blue**: Retrace their steps for more clues.

### Green  
At the art wall, Spring had indeed borrowed the ladder to paint a tall tree. “Oops! I forgot to return it!”

### Yellow  
In the garden, Rosie spotted paint footprints and a flower petal path... leading back to the art wall.

### Red  
The owl hooted from his branch. “The ladder? Last I saw, it was near the painting meadow!”

### Blue  
Along the trail, they found paint smudges and a broken crayon. “Looks like someone went to the art wall,” said Sadie.

Spring beamed when she saw them. “I was decorating the wall with our playground adventures!”  

The ladder leaned nearby, speckled with blue and yellow paint.  

“I’m all done now. Let’s bring it back!”

**Green**: Carry the ladder as a team.  
**Yellow**: Clean off the paint first.  
**Red**: Admire Spring’s painting.  
**Blue**: Invite more friends to help.

### Green  
They balanced the ladder carefully, giggling when Carrot nearly tipped over. “Teamwork!” Rosie cheered.

### Yellow  
Sadie Spot dipped a sponge in the creek and wiped off the paint. “Now it’s like new!”

### Red  
Spring had painted all four of them on the slide. “This is beautiful,” said Rosie softly.

### Blue  
More forest friends arrived. “Can we help?” chirped a chipmunk. The ladder was returned in no time!

At last — the playground was whole again!  

The slide gleamed in the sunlight, and the ladder stood tall. The friends high-fived (and high-hoofed and high-pawed).  

What should they do to celebrate?

**Green**: Race down the slide.  
**Yellow**: Put on a silly play.  
**Red**: Build a fort under the jungle gym.  
**Blue**: Have a forest picnic.

### Green  
Carrot zoomed down first, ears flying! “Wheee!” Sadie giggled all the way down after him.

### Yellow  
Rosie made a flower crown for Sadie, who declared herself Queen of Slides. Everyone acted in the royal play!

### Red  
Spring dug a cozy tunnel under the gym. “This is our new clubhouse!” she yipped.

### Blue  
They set out berries, cookies, and acorn muffins. “Best snack ever!” said Carrot with a full mouth.

The sun began to dip low.  

“Let’s do one more fun thing before we go,” said Rosie, stretching.  

What should their last adventure be?

**Green**: Create a secret handshake.  
**Yellow**: Invent a new game.  
**Red**: Draw the mystery in the dirt.  
**Blue**: Bury a time capsule.

### Green  
“Bunny bounce, kitten paw, deer stomp, puppy tail wag!” said Spring. They all laughed and did it twice more.

### Yellow  
They invented “Slide Tag” — whoever slid down had to chase the others! Carrot was very fast.

### Red  
Sadie Spot sketched the trail of clues, the squirrel’s cart, and the whole gang. “Now we’ll always remember,” she said.

### Blue  
They buried a treasure box with drawings, a bolt from the slide, and a note: “To future playground adventurers — have fun!”

The clearing glowed gold as the sun set.  

Carrot flopped down, happy and tired. Sadie curled beside him, Rosie nibbled a clover, and Spring sprawled belly-up.  

“Today was perfect,” said Rosie.

**Green**: Watch the stars come out.  
**Yellow** Share favorite moments.  
**Red**: Plan tomorrow’s adventures.  
**Blue**: Whisper goodnight wishes.

### Green  
They lay on their backs and counted the stars. “That one looks like a bunny,” whispered Sadie.

### Yellow  
“Best part?” said Spring. “Zooming down the slide!”  
“Teamwork,” said Rosie. “Definitely teamwork.”

### Red  
“Let’s build a zipline next!” said Carrot, eyes sparkling.  
“Maybe after a nap,” yawned Sadie.

### Blue  
“Goodnight, friends,” whispered Carrot. “Goodnight, slide. Goodnight, sparkly trail.”

Night settled over Maple Hollow. Fireflies flickered above the playground.  

The mystery was solved. The slide was home.  

The four friends huddled close, feeling proud and peaceful.

**Green**: Snuggle into a cozy blanket.  
**Yellow**: Tell a gentle bedtime tale.  
**Red**: Hum a lullaby together.  
**Blue**: Each say what they’re thankful for.

### Green  
Rosie brought out her softest mossy blanket. “It smells like the forest,” she smiled.

### Yellow  
Sadie whispered a tale of a moonbeam that turned into a slide. Everyone sighed dreamily.

### Red  
Spring hummed the tune from earlier. Soon they were all humming along, eyes drifting closed.

### Blue  
“I’m thankful for clues,” said Carrot. “And friends,” added Rosie. “And art!” said Spring. “And cozy endings,” murmured Sadie.
